## Contents

## Project Goals

- To create a quiz that covers a wide variety of subjects.
- To have the score displayed at the end.
- To be able to enter a user name and have displayed with the score.
- To have a reset or restart button.
- There will be a choice of answers to choose from.
- The correct answer will be displayed when the question is answered.
- For the quiz to be the same as a timed exam, when the time is up the quiz will end.

### User Feedback

- Liked the questions, and would nice if there was dificulty levels like easy mediun or hard level.
- Have a category for different questions, e.g. Science, history, TV, Movie and pick the category at the start of the quiz.
- A user didn't know that the quiz would end after 20 seconds, so I implemented that the submit and start button would only appear after the rules have been opened.
- The quiz time limit was originally 20 seconds, and some peoples feedback said that the 20secs wasn't enough, so the time was increased to 25 seconds.
- One user would like it if there could be dificulty levels with the time also, having a choice of 20 sec or 25 secs or 30 sec per question.
- Have a leader board for a group of people to compare scores.
- One user wanted to be able a check there answer after it was answered before moving onto the next question, which would mean for the timer to stop and start again. This was covered below in the Future Adaptations section of the README.



## Features

- There are 10 questions that appeared randomly out of a totol of 40.
- The players score is visible on the screen under the quiz.
- There is a countdown timer which end the quiz after 25 seconds if the question isn't answered,which appears after the start button is pressed.
- There is a progress counter which appears after the start button is pressed.

## Design

- I wanted to be able to see the background image so the "quiz-section" class was made transparent by 0.5.
- The Rules button is flashing at the start of the quiz to let users know that it needs to be pressed.
- The colour when the buttons are hover over was picked using the eye dropper in chrome developer where the colour can be changed. The colour was picked from the red circle in the image below. This colour is repeated in the image also, in tsome jugs and bowls in the image.
