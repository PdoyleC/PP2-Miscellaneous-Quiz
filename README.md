## Future Adaptations

- I'd like to implement an end of quiz statement in relation to the score, i.e. if the score was below 4 there would be a message to say something along the lines of "more study is needed".
- In the future I'd like to add smaller indicators, to show which question was selected and the correct answer if the incorrect was selected.
